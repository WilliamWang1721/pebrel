//! AI lifecycle integration. The dependency flow is:
//! transport -> protocol/payload -> typed events -> ordering -> pane lifecycle.
//!
//! UI adapters render the shared lifecycle and deliver its notifications. They
//! never reinterpret a completed hook by scanning terminal prose. Screen evidence
//! is an explicit fallback for capabilities absent from the active integration.
//!
//! `PEBREL_HOOK_LOG` (legacy `NEBULA_HOOK_LOG`) diagnoses bridge delivery without
//! payloads; `GateVerdict` explains rejected events in application debug logs.
